# Hello World
Quick little Java Hello World program but with interesting graphics and some [funky] music  

Would use mp3 files for much smaller file size but for some reason cannot find any useable minimalist/lightweight mp3 player libraries and this project isn't important enough for me to "waste my time" anymore
