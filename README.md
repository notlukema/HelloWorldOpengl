# Hello World
Quick little Java Hello World program but with interesting graphics (using opengl) and some [funky] music  

Would use mp3 files for much smaller file size but for some reason cannot find any useable minimalist/lightweight mp3 player libraries and this project isn't important enough for me to "waste my time" anymore  

When I have time I will update the project a little bit in order to solve:
1. The massive file size due to .wav files
2. Resizing the window
